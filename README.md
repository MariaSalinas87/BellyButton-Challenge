# BellyButton-Challenge
Roza has been working with bacteria from the belly button. There are many samples and different bacterias she has worked with. 

She needs to create some graphs that reflect her data. She will create a horizontal bar chart. a bubble chart, and a gauge chart. She will be customizing the Dashboard as well.

With her information, her volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in teir belly buttons.
